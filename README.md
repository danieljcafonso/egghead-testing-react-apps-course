# Testing React Apps with Jest and React Testing Library

**Hey there!** Welcome to **Testing React Apps with Jest and React Testing Library Course**

So you might be wondering a couple of things:

## What do I need to know before the course?

Well there is only one requirement and that is, React. If you are not familiar with React I recommend taking Kent C. Dodds free [Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react)

## What will I be learning?

During this course you'll learn the fundamentals of creating a test with Jest and a full guide to using the React Testing Library to test your React application.

## Who are you?
Hey there, my name is Daniel Afonso and I'm from Portugal. I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer at Cera and an Auth0 Ambassador.

I've been using the React Testing Library for the past 3 years and have even contributed to improving its code and docs. 
I've always seen tests as the most important thing of writing code and thanks to Jest and the React Testing Library I have full confidence on my code and I'm able to sleep better at night.
